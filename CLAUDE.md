# Claude Code Guidance

This file gives Claude Code project-specific context. Read SPEC.md for the full technical specification.

## Project context

Personal tool for an IPSC competitor to extract shot splits from head-mounted camera footage. The user is an experienced developer who uses Claude Code daily. They prefer:
- Concise, direct communication
- Pushing back when something is wrong rather than agreeing reflexively
- Asking clarifying questions before diving into detailed implementations

## Code conventions

- Python 3.11+, type hints everywhere
- `uv` for dependency management — never use `pip` directly
- Pydantic for data validation
- `pathlib.Path` for paths, never strings
- f-strings for formatting
- Black formatting (line length 100)
- Ruff for linting
- Imports: stdlib, third-party, local — separated by blank lines
- No relative imports beyond a single dot (`.module`, not `..module`)

## Architecture rules

1. **Detection logic stays out of the CLI.** `cli.py` orchestrates; analysis happens in dedicated modules.
2. **Pure functions where possible.** Detection functions take audio data + config and return results. No file I/O inside detection logic.
3. **Pydantic models for all data crossing module boundaries.** No dicts of unknown shape passed around.
4. **Configuration is data, not code.** Tunable parameters go in `config.py` as Pydantic models with defaults; users can override via YAML.
5. **Every detection module has fixture-based tests.** Don't merge a detection change without a test that would have caught it.

## Testing approach

- `pytest` for everything
- Fixtures live in `tests/fixtures/` — short audio clips with hand-labeled ground truth in adjacent JSON files
- Detection tests assert within tolerance (e.g., ±15ms for shot times)
- Mock ffmpeg in trim tests; don't actually shell out during unit tests
- Integration tests can use real ffmpeg but mark them with `@pytest.mark.integration`

## When in doubt

- **Ask before guessing.** Especially about audio detection thresholds, FCPXML structure, or anything user-facing.
- **Default to the conservative choice.** Better to under-detect shots and flag uncertainty than to invent shots from echoes.
- **Optimize for the audit trail.** Every analysis should produce a report file the user can review later. Don't silently make decisions.

## What this project is NOT

- A real-time tool. All processing is offline batch.
- A library. Single-purpose application.

## Detection pipeline (current, post-ensemble work)

The shot-detection pipeline is a 4-voter ensemble, not raw signal processing:

- **Voter A** -- ``splitsmith.shot_detect`` envelope onsets, gated at the
  auto-calibrated ``min_confidence`` floor (the lowest positive-shot
  confidence across the calibration set). This is the candidate generator;
  every other voter sees only candidates A emits.
- **Voter B** -- threshold on a hand-crafted feature vector
  (see ``scripts/build_ensemble_fixture.py``); calibrated against labeled
  fixtures.
- **Voter C** -- trained ``sklearn`` ``GradientBoostingClassifier`` over the
  same hand features; calibrated to a target recall on the same set.
- **Voter D** -- PANN audio-tagging features thresholded against the
  calibration distribution.
- **Consensus** -- a candidate is kept when ``vote_total + apriori_boost
  >= consensus`` (default 3-of-4). The apriori boost biases toward
  expected-shot-count regions when prior info is known.

This pipeline lives in ``scripts/build_ensemble_fixture.py`` and produces
fixtures under ``build/ensemble-review/``. It is **not yet wired into the
production UI's shot-detect endpoint** -- doing so is open work; until
then the UI seeds shots[] from raw voter-A candidates with a static
confidence cutoff, which under- or over-keeps depending on the clip.

## Things Claude Code should not do

- Add new dependencies without asking. The dep list is small on purpose.
- Refactor the architecture without discussion. The pipeline structure in SPEC.md is intentional.
- Add features not in SPEC.md without confirming they belong.
- Generate fake test fixtures. Real audio samples or skip the test.

## First-session checklist

When starting fresh on this project:
1. Read SPEC.md fully before writing code.
2. Check that `uv`, `ffmpeg`, and Python 3.11+ are available.
3. Set up the project skeleton (pyproject.toml, src layout, tests dir).
4. Get a sample video from the user before tuning detection thresholds.
5. Build modules in pipeline order: video_match → beep_detect → trim → shot_detect → csv_gen → fcpxml_gen → cli.
6. Test each module against fixtures before moving to the next.

## Useful prior context

The user has prior data sources from match scoring. Example JSON format is in `examples/` — review it before designing the stage matching logic. Field names matter: `time_seconds`, `scorecard_updated_at`, `stage_number`, `stage_name`, `competitor_id`, `division`, `club`.

The tool should be agnostic to division but the user typically shoots Production Optics, where splits in the 0.15-0.40s range are typical for accurate-paced shooting; use that for sensible defaults.
